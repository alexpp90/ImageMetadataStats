/**
 * The merge rule that keeps a background pass from rolling the screen back.
 *
 * Pure, so none of it needs a dispatcher — which matters, because the version
 * this replaces was wrong for two years and no test caught it: the only way to
 * reach it was through a `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` hop that escapes virtual
 * time, so every attempt to test it through the ViewModel was a race.
