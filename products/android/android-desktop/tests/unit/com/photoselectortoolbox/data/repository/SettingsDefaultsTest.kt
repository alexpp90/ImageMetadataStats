/**
 * The defaults a photographer gets before they have chosen anything.
 *
 * These are product decisions, not implementation details, so they are pinned
 * where a build can fail on them rather than left as a literal beside a
 * DataStore key. A default that drifts is a change nobody reviews: it does not
 * show up as a behaviour change in any test that sets the preference first, and
 * every test in the instrumented suite sets this one first.
 *
 * The constants are `const val`, so these assertions are resolved at compile
 * time and need no Android runtime.
