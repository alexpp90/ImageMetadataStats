/**
 * An application-lifetime coroutine scope for work that must outlive the screen
 * that started it.
 *
 * Two things in the selector need this and cannot use `viewModelScope`:
 *
 * 1. **Optimistic filing.** Move and Copy are applied to the list before the
 *    file system confirms them, so the transfer is still running after the frame
 *    has left the screen. Cancelling it because the user navigated away would
 *    leave a half-written file in the Selection.
 * 2. **Deferred deletion.** A delete is only committed to disk when its undo
 *    window closes — which is frequently *after* the selector is gone. On
 *    `viewModelScope` the commit would be cancelled and the photograph would
 *    silently reappear on the next folder open.
 *
 * `SupervisorJob` so one failed transfer does not cancel the others, and
 * `Dispatchers.IO` because everything launched here is file or network work.
