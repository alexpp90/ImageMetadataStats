/**
 * The words on the two controls that file a photograph into the Selection.
 *
 * There is one rule here and it is worth stating plainly: **the button says
 * what it does.** An earlier draft of this screen called the copy control
 * "Keep", which is a euphemism — it describes how the photographer feels about
 * the frame, not what happens to the file. Under a "move" configuration the
 * same euphemism is actively wrong, because the file leaves the source folder.
 * PhotoTok already learned this exact lesson (see the 2026-07-31 entry in
 * `ai/memory/palette.md`), and a unit test here asserts the word never comes
 * back.
 *
 * Both verbs are always on screen. The one named by the user's Filing Action
 * setting is the [primary] — first position, tonal fill — and the other is
 * [secondary]. Neither is hidden: a photographer who wants to copy this one
 * frame while normally moving must not have to open Settings to do it.
 *
 * The second rule is newer and comes from the same family of defect: **the
 * destination is a setting, not a constant.** Every function here takes the
 * configured `selection_folder_name`, exactly as
 * [com.photoselectortoolbox.domain.guidance.SelectorHintText.message] does, so
 * the hint card and the snackbar that fire alongside each other cannot name
 * different folders. The parameter defaults to
 * [FilingAction.DEFAULT_SELECTION_FOLDER] for call sites that genuinely have no
 * settings in hand.
 *
 * Kept free of Compose and Android types so the wording is unit-testable.
