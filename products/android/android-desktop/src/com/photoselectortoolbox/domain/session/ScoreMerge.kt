/**
 * Folding computed scores back into a list that did not stand still.
 *
 * Both producers of a [ScanResult] — the Room cache restore and the scan itself
 * — work from a snapshot: the restore reads one row per photograph off the IO
 * dispatcher, the scan streams progress over minutes. Meanwhile EXIF and image
 * dimensions are being written into the same items by their own coroutines.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent is subtle because the wrong version looks like
 * a merge:
 *
 * ```
 * if (image.scanResult != null) image else byUri[image.uri] ?: image
 * ```
 *
 * `byUri` holds copies of the *pre-work* snapshot, so for every image that did
 * not already have a score — which, in an unscanned folder, is all of them —
 * that line replaces a live item with a stale one and reverts whatever landed
 * in between. EXIF is only re-fetched on navigation, so the frame the
 * photographer was looking at simply stayed blank.
 *
 * The rule, then: **merge the field you computed, never the item you computed
 * it from.** Kept pure and free of Android and coroutine types so it can be
 * tested without a dispatcher, which is the other half of why the original went
 * unnoticed.
