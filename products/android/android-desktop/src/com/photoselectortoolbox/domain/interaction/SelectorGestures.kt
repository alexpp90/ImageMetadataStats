 * The one place a gesture's meaning is written down.
 *
 * The shipped viewer claimed "swipe ← → navigate" on its hint card while a
 * leftward swipe **deleted the photograph**, a rightward swipe dismissed the
 * viewer, and navigation was a vertical pager. Three of the five lines on that
 * card were false, and the single destructive action in the viewer was bound to
 * the gesture the card described as harmless.
 *
 * That was not a copy bug. It was a card written by hand next to bindings
 * written somewhere else, with nothing forcing them to agree. So the bindings
 * and the wording are now the same object: the viewer reads [FullscreenGesture]
 * to decide what a gesture does, the hint card reads it to decide what to say,
 * and a hint row that does not correspond to a binding cannot be expressed.
 *
 * Kept free of Compose and Android types so every rule here is unit-testable.
