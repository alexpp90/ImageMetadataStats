 * The list edit an action applies **before** the file system has confirmed it,

 * Filing a frame must feel instant: waiting on a SAF copy of a 60 MB raw file
 * before the next photograph appears is exactly the moment the app must not
 * stall. So the list moves first and the transfer runs on the
 * `@ApplicationScope` scope behind it. That makes the list briefly *ahead* of
 * the file system, and a failure then has to be undone — otherwise the app has
 * told the photographer a frame was filed while it is still sitting in the
 * source folder.

     *   insertion cannot displace a later one's position.
     * - The resulting index is re-derived from the **URI** of the frame that was
     *   on screen, never from the stored integer. Re-inserting ahead of the
     *   photographer must not move them onto a different photograph.
