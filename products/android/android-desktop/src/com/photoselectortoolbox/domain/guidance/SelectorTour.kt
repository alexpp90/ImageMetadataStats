 * labels is the weakest possible way to explain a control the user can already
 * see* — and on this product every control that acts on a photograph already
 * carries a permanent word and a permanent mono key cap, so a list of those keys
 * was documenting what was already legible.
 *
 * What the user genuinely cannot work out by looking is **where things are and
 * why**: that the sidebar is session actions above and destinations below, that
 * the three frames are one comparison at one size, that the block right of the
 * centre frame acts on the centre frame only. That is spatial, so the guide is
 * spatial: each region of the layout gets one callout in the slack beside it.
 *
 * The keys are then split by whether anything on screen can be pointed at.
 * [SelectorShortcut.FILE_PRIMARY], `Del`, `F`, `←` and `→` all drive a labelled
 * control, so they belong to that control's callout; `1`/`2`/`3`, `Esc` and `?`
 * drive nothing visible, so they get a callout of their own. Every binding
 * appears exactly once across the whole guide, and a unit test asserts the
 * advertised set equals the bound set.
 *
 * Kept free of Compose and Android types so all of it is unit-testable.
