 * **Identities only — no wording lives here.** Every one of these hints
 * describes an action whose effect depends on configuration: what the filing
 * control does is decided by the *Filing Action* setting, so the copy must be
 * built from
 * [com.photoselectortoolbox.domain.format.SelectionActionLabels] /
 * [com.photoselectortoolbox.domain.interaction.FilingAction] at render time. A
 * hard-coded "Keep"/"Save"/"Favourite" is prohibited by REQUIREMENTS §2 and was
 * shipped once already in PhotoTok (see the 2026-07-31 entries in
 * `ai/memory/palette.md`). Putting a string on this enum is how that comes back.
 *
 * [key] is persisted in DataStore and is therefore on users' devices: renaming
 * one re-shows a hint that has already been dismissed. Add new entries, do not
 * repurpose old ones.
