/**
 * The session actions in the upper half of the sidebar, as data.
 *
 * One declaration, read twice: [com.photoselectortoolbox.ui.selector.SelectorSidebar]
 * renders the word under each glyph, and the guide explains what the glyph
 * means beside the real item. Written out in two places they drift, and a
 * legend that names a control something the control does not call itself is
 * worse than no legend.
 *
 * [label] is the word that fits under an 88 dp glyph. [meaning] is the line the
 * guide shows beside it — what the control *does*, not what it is called, since
 * the name is already legible on screen.
 *
 * Compose-free so the wording stays unit-testable on the JVM; the glyph for each
 * is chosen by an exhaustive `when` in the UI, so an action added here without
 * one does not build.
