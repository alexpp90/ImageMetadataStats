# Agent Instructions

Welcome to the Image Metadata Analyzer project. When modifying this codebase, you must adhere to the following rules:

1. **Keep Requirements Updated:** You must read the `REQUIREMENTS.md` file in the root directory before starting work on new features, modifying existing features, or changing project architecture/behavior.
2. **Update After Changes:** If your task introduces new requirements, alters existing rules (e.g., UI layout, threading models, duplicate logic, dependency lists), or deprecates features, you MUST update `REQUIREMENTS.md` to reflect these changes before finalizing your work.
3. **Consistency:** Ensure that any code changes you make perfectly align with the rules specified in `REQUIREMENTS.md` unless the user explicitly instructs you to change those rules.
4. **Testing Context:** Review the testing and headless execution requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md` (e.g., using `xvfb-run`) when running tests or debugging GUI components.
